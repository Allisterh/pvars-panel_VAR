# R-Package 'pvars'

This package implements (1) panel cointegration rank tests,
(2) estimators for panels of VAR, and (3) panel-based
identification methods for structural vector autoregressive
(SVAR) models. The implemented functions allow to account
for cross-sectional dependence in the residuals and for
structural breaks in the mean and linear trend of the VAR
process.
